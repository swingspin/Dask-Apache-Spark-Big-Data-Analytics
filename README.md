# Spark-Dask---Big-Data-Analytics

A Compartive analysis of two leading Big Data technologies, Dask and Apache Spark using :
1. Programming model: Use of Data-frame API to experience the working of Dask in comparison to Apache Spark.
2. Internals of Dask: Gain insights on how it schedules its tasks and achieves parallel computation. Also, analysis on how different it is from Spark, understand the technical differences with Spark.
hence,
âž¢ Building on Dask documentation for teaching and future research works.
1) Parallelism in Dask - IPYNB File
2) Spark dataframe work - IPYNB File
3) Dask and panda dataframe work - IPYNB File
4) Comparison summary - pdf file of Dask vs Spark- highlighting the differences, and benchmark the different execution times.
